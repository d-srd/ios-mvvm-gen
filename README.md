# ios-mvvm-gen

A quick and dirty Ruby script to generate an MVVMP template per screen.

### Usage: 
* make sure you have the 'xcodeproj' gem installed
* add the script to your $PATH
* go to your root project directory
* run the script:
  * first argument: folder where you want the generated files to go
  * second argument: name of screen
* enjoy


### TODO:
* automatically add group if one does not exist
* implement target picking / per project config?
* make it possible to generate multiple screens in single group
* make it possible to generate multiple screens in multiple groups
